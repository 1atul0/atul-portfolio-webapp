    <p>My primary interests lie in competitive programming and development, and I've honed my skills in C++ through solving DSA and logic-based problems.</p>

   <p> Currently, I'm exploring full stack web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with other frameworks. I've completed several projects in web development, and I'm always looking for opportunities to gain more experience and work on real-world projects.</p>
    
    <p>As a software developer, I'm dedicated to continuously improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. I'm a motivated self-starter who enjoys working on challenging projects and collaborating with others to achieve common goals.</p>
